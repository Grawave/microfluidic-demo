# Optimized Parallel Channels - Increased Flow
# Same 40 channels as baseline, but higher pressure drop for more flow
# Target: prevent fluid boiling (keep outlet < 80°C)

# Design rationale:
# - Keep same channel geometry (300x300 μm) - proven effective
# - Increase pressure drop from 10 kPa → 25 kPa (2.5x)
# - This increases flow from ~160 → ~400 ml/min (2.5x)
# - Higher flow removes heat faster, preventing boiling
# - Still laminar (Re ~ 550 << 2300)
# - Trade-off: requires more powerful pump
